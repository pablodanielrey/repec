Title: Distributive Implications of Fertility Changes in Latin America

Abstract: Fertility rates significantly fell over the last decades in Latin America. In
order to assess the extent to which these changes contributed to the observed
reduction in income poverty and inequality we apply microeconometric
decompositions to microdata from national household surveys from seven
Latin American countries. We find that changes in fertility rates were
associated to a non-negligible reduction in inequality and poverty in the
region. The main channel was straightforward: lower fertility implied
smaller families and hence larger per capita incomes. Lower fertility also
fostered labor force participation, especially among women, which
contributed to the reduction of poverty and inequality in most countries,
although the size of this effect was smaller.
