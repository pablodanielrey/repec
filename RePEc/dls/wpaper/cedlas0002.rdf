Title: Income Inequality in Latin America and the Caribbean: Evidence from Household Surveys
Abstract: This paper reports information on income inequality in Latin America and the Caribbean
computed from a sample of more than 50 household surveys from 20 LAC countries from
1989 to 2001. Although the core of the statistics is on household income inequality, we also
report results on aggregate welfare and polarization. Inequality has moderately increased in
South America in the last decade. The two main exceptions are Argentina, with a very large
inequality increase, and Brazil, where inequality actually decreased. Changes have not been
significant in Central America and the Caribbean. Aggregate welfare has increased in most
countries fueled by economic growth and despite unequalizing distributional changes.
