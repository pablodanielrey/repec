Title:  Argentina´s Distributional Failure: The role of Integration and Public Policies
Abstract:  This paper documents the income distribution changes experienced by Argentina
during the last decades. Inequality substantially increased, and despite economic
growth during some periods, poverty also went significantly up. Two types of
episodes have shaped Argentina’s income distribution: deep macroeconomic
crisis and periods of openness and integration. The sizeable raise in inequality in
the 90s seems to be associated to reallocations against unskilled-labor intensive
sectors, and especially to skilled-biased technological change within most
sectors, both factors stimulated by the process of economic integration. The
depth and speed of the reforms and the absence of public policies to ease the
transition contributed to the particular severity of the income distribution
changes in Argentina.
