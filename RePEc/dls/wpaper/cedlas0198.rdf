Title: Chronicle of a Deceleration Foretold: Income inequality in Latin America in the 2010s

Abstract: After a decade of strong progress toward the goal of reducing the high
levels of income disparities, there are clear signs of a deceleration in the
pace of inequality reduction in Latin America. This paper argues that the
deceleration is the result of two set of reasons. First, several of the driving
factors of the fall in inequality in the 2000s have lost strength, due to
“natural” motives; and second, the external conditions faced by the Latin
American economies have worsened in the early 2010s, making further
reductions in inequality more difficult.
