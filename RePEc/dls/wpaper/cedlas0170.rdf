Title: Is the Glass Half Empty or Half Full? Enrollment,
Graduation, and Dropout Rates in Latin America

Abstract: We use 292 household surveys from 18 Latin American countries to document patterns in secondary
school graduation rates over the period 1990-2010. We find that enrollment and graduation rates
increased during that period while dropout rates decreased. We provide two types of explanations for
these patterns. Countries implemented changes on the supply side to increase access, by increasing the
resources allocated to education and designing policies to help students staying in school. Despite this
progress, graduation rates are still generally low, there still persist remarkable gaps in educational
outcomes in terms of gender, income quintiles, and regions within countries, and the quality of
education is generally low.
