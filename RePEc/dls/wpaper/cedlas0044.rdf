Title: Crime Distribution and Victim Behavior during a Crime Wave
Abstract: The study of how crime affects different income groups faces several difficulties. The
first is that crime-avoiding activities vary across income groups. Thus, a lower
victimization rate in one group may not reflect a lower burden of crime, but rather a
higher investment in avoiding crime. A second difficulty is that, typically, only a small
fraction of the population is victimized so that empirical tests often lack the statistical
power to detect differences across groups. We take advantage of a dramatic increase in
crime rates in Argentina during the late 1990s to document several interesting patterns.
First, the increase in victimization experienced by the poor is larger than the increase
endured by the rich. The difference appears large: low-income people have experienced
increases in victimization rates that are almost 50 percent higher than those suffered by
high-income people. Second, for home robberies, where the rich can protect themselves
(by hiring private security, for example), we find significantly larger increases in
victimization rates amongst the poor. In contrast, for robberies on the street, where the
rich can only mimic the poor, we find similar increases in victimization for both income
groups. Third, we document direct evidence on pecuniary and non-pecuniary protection
activities by both the rich and poor, ranging from the avoidance of dark places to the
hiring of private security. Fourth, we show the correlations between changes in protection
and mimicking and changes in crime victimization. Fifth, we offer one possible way of
using these estimates to explain the incidence of crime across income groups.
