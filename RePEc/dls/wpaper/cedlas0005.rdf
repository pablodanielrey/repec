Title:  Capital Accumulation, Trade Liberalization and Rising Wage Inequality: The Case of Argentina
Abstract:  Capital accumulation can modify the relative productivity between skilled and unskilled
workers, thus leading to changes in the wage structure. In particular, if capital goods are
relatively more complementary to skilled workers in the production function (skill-biased
technologies), a positive correlation between investment in physical capital and the wage
premium would be expected. In this paper we present evidence for this hypothesis by taking
advantage of the variability in wage premia and capital investment across industries in the
Argentine manufacturing sector. We conclude that the wage premium for workers with
complete college education increased more in those industries with higher investment in
machinery and equipment. As in Galiani and Sanguinetti (2003, in this journal), the wage
premium also grew more in those sectors which faced strong import competition, although
this effect is empirically less relevant than the capital accumulation effect.
