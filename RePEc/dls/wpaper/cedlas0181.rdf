Title: Female Labor Force Participation in Latin America:
Evidence of Deceleration

Abstract: This paper documents changes in female labor force participation (LFP) in Latin America
exploiting a large database of microdata from household surveys of 15 countries in the
period 1992-2012. We find evidence for a significant deceleration in the rate of increase of
female LFP in the 2000s, breaking the marked increasing pattern that characterized the
region for at least 50 years. The paper documents and characterizes this fact and examines
various factors that could be driving the deceleration. Through a set of simple
decompositions the paper helps to disentangle whether the patterns in female LFP are
mainly accounted for by changes in the distribution of some direct determinants of the
labor supply decision (e.g. education), or instead they are chiefly the consequence of some
more profound transformation in behavior.
