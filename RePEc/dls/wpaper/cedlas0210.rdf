Title: How Is the Internet Changing Labor Market
Arrangements? Evidence from Telecommunications
Reforms in Europe

Abstract: This paper exploits variations in the timing of telecommunications
reforms across Europe to analyze the relationship between the rise of
alternative work arrangements and the emergence of the Internet. The
paper evaluates whether sectors that are technologically more
dependent on information and communications technologies
experienced disproportionately larger changes in their employment
outcomes after telecommunications reforms were introduced. The main
results point to a disproportionate increase in total employment, parttime
work, and home-based work among information and
communications technologies–intensive sectors after the
implementation of telecommunications reforms. The analysis does not
find a link between the incidence of temporary employment, selfemployment,
second job holding, and telecommunications reforms. The
main results are robust to several specifications.
