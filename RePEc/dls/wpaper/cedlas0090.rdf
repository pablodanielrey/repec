Title: Income and Beyond: Multidimensional Poverty in six Latin American countries

Abstract: This paper presents empirical results of a wide range of multidimensional poverty measures for:
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, Mexico and Uruguay, for the period 1992–2006. 
Six dimensions are analysed: income, child attendance at school, education of the household head, sanitation, water and
shelter. Over the study period, El Salvador, Brazil, Mexico and Chile experienced significant reductions
of multidimensional poverty. In contrast, in urban Uruguay there was a small reduction in
multidimensional poverty, while in urban Argentina the estimates did not change significantly. El
Salvador, Brazil and Mexico together with rural areas of Chile display significantly higher and more
simultaneous deprivations than urban areas of Argentina, Chile and Uruguay. In all countries, access to
proper sanitation and education of the household head are the highest contributors to overall
multidimensional poverty.
