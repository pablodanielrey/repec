Title: Skills, Exports, and the Wages of Seven Million Latin American Workers
Abstract: The returns to schooling and the skill premium are key parameters in various elds and
policy debates, including the literatures on globalization and inequality, international
migration, and technological change. This paper explores the skill premium and its
correlation with exports in Latin America, thus linking the skill premium to the emerg-
ing literature on the structure of trade and development. Using data on employment
and wages for over seven million workers from sixteen Latin American economies, the
authors estimate national and industry-specic returns to schooling and skill premi-
ums and study some of their determinants. The evidence suggests that both country
and industry characteristics are important in explaining returns to schooling and skill
premiums. The analyses also suggest that the incidence of exports within industries,
the average income per capita within countries, and the relative abundance of skilled
workers are related to the underlying industry and country characteristics that explain
these parameters. In particular, sectoral exports are positively correlated with the
skill premium at the industry level, a result that supports recent trade models linking
exports with wages and the demand for skills.
