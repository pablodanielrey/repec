Title: On the Distributive Costs of Drug-Related
Homicides

Abstract: Reliable estimates of the effects of violence on economic outcomes are scarce. We
exploit the manyfold increase in homicides in 2008-2011 in Mexico resulting from its war on
organized drug traffickers to estimate the effect of drug-related homicides on house prices.
We use an unusually rich dataset that provides national coverage on house prices and
homicides and exploit within-municipality variations. We find that the impact of violence on
housing prices is borne entirely by the poor sectors of the population. An increase in homicides
equivalent to one standard deviation leads to a 3% decrease in the price of low-income
housing. In spite of this large burden on the poor, the willingness to pay in order to reverse the
increase in drug-related crime is not high. We estimate it to be approximately 0.1% of Mexico’s
GDP.
