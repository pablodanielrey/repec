Title: A Conceptual Framework for Integrated Economic-Environmental Modelling

Abstract: Economy-wide models such as Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Models are powerful
tools that provide insights on policy impacts on standard economic indicators. With the recent
publication of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounts (SEEA), the power of this
approach is amplified. This paper addresses an important gap in economy-wide policy modelling
applications and literature by developing a conceptual framework for the integration of the
SEEA in the CGE framework, enabling for the first time the analysis of policy impacts on the
economy and the environment in a quantitative, comprehensive and consistent framework.
Previous integrated modelling efforts have generally focused on the interaction between the
economy and one environmental resource in isolation, requiring significant data reconciliation.
Integration of SEEA into a CGE circumvents this resource intense process, enhancing analytical
power, obviating the need for strong assumptions in reconciling economic-environmental data,
reducing start-up costs, and increasing the timeliness of evidence-based policy advice.
