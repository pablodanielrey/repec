Title: Equality of Opportunity and Optimal Cash and In-Kind Policies
Abstract: This paper examines the argument for public provision of certain private goods, like education and health,
based on equality of opportunity by studying the utility possibility frontier of a society in which there is a
concern for the distribution of these goods. A given quality of education or health services can be consumed
for free in the public sector, but people can opt-out and purchase their desired quality levels in the private
sector. Some of the conclusions are: (i) a pure cash transfer is optimal when the utility redistribution is
either “sufficiently” small or large; (ii) if and only if both the equality-of-opportunity concern and the utility
redistribution are large enough, can an in-kind program which attracts the whole population be justified;
(iii) even when everybody chooses the in-kind program, it may be optimal to perform some additional utility
redistribution by increasing the size of such program.
