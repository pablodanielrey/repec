Title: The Heterogeneous Impact of Conditional Cash
Transfers

Abstract: The Honduran PRAF experiment randomly assigned conditional cash transfers to 40 of
70 poor municipalities, within five strata defined by a poverty proxy. Using census data, we
show that eligible children were 8 percentage points more likely to enroll in school and 3
percentage points less likely to work. The effects were much larger in the two poorest strata, and
statistically insignificant in the other three (the latter finding is robust to the use of a separate
regression-discontinuity design). Heterogeneity confirms the importance of judicious targeting to
maximize the impact and cost-effectiveness of CCTs. There is no consistent evidence of effects
on ineligible children or on adult labor supply.
