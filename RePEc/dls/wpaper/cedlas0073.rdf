Title: Are Informal Workers Secondary Workers?: Evidence for Argentina

Abstract: Empirical studies attempting at testing dualism in developing countries often rely
on an ex-ante definition of the primary and the secondary sector. Many times this
methodology causes biases in the estimation due to sample selection problems. Also,
such definitions may be arbitrary sometimes. We use twenty seven years of Household
Data in order to test for the existence dual labor markets in Argentina. We estimated
an endogenous switching model with unknown regime without defining ex-ante sector
attachment. We find evidence of dualism for both periods analyzed. However, the
diferences between the two sectors have signi¯cantly changed over time. Finally, our
estimations also corroborate the fact that using the usual ex-ante definition of sector
attachment may not be adequate for testing dualism.
