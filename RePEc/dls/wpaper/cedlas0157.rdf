Title: Employment and Labor Regulation: Evidence from
Manufacturing Firms in Bolivia, 1988-2007

Abstract: This paper analyzes the effects of labor regulation on employment for Bolivian registered
manufacturing firms during 1988 to 2007. By estimating job flows we find that firms with high
temporary worker rates (as a proxy of lower labor regulation costs) are those with both higher job
reallocation rates and higher net employment growth, and only they contributed to employment
growth during the country economic downturn, 1998-1999. In addition, by estimating demand
functions we find that labor regulation changes (measured through the compulsory basic salary and
the major labor costs derived from the new pension law) entailed costs in terms of permanent
employment losses.
