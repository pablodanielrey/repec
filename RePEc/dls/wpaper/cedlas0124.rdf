Title: Trends in Tariff Reforms and Trends in the Structure of Wages
Abstract: This paper provides new evidence on the impacts of trade reforms on wages. We first
introduce a model of trade that combines a non-competitive wage setting mechanism
due to unions with a factor abundance hypothesis. The predictions of the model
are then econometrically investigated using Argentine data. Instead of achieving
identification by comparing industrial wages before and after one episode of trade
liberalization, our strategy exploits the recent historical record of policy changes
adopted by Argentina: from significant protection in the early 1970s, to the first episode
of liberalization during the late 1970s, then back to a slowdown of reforms during the
1980s, and finally to the second episode of liberalization in the 1990s. These swings
in trade policy represent broken trends in trade reforms that we can compare with
observed trends in wages and wage inequality. We use unusual historical data sets
of trends in tariffs, wages, and wage inequality to examine the structure of wages in
Argentina and to explore how it is affected by tariff reforms. We find that i) trade
liberalization, ceteris paribus, reduces wages; ii) industry tariffs reduce the industry
skill premium; iii) conditional on the structure of tariffs at the industry level, the
average tariff in the economy is positively associated with the aggregate skill premium.
These findings suggest that the observed trends in wage inequality in Latin America
can be reconciled with the Stolper-Samuelson predictions in a model with unions.
