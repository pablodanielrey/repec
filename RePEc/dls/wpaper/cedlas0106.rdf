Title: “I Can Hear the Grass Grow”: The Anatomy of Distributive Changes in Argentina
Abstract: We present a detailed description of the drastic changes in many aspects of
the distribution of income in Argentina, complementing a recent study by Gasparini
and Cruces (2009), who focus mostly on inequality. We use modern descriptive tools
to provide a complete map of the changes in many aspects of the distribution of
income, and stress the fact that other key measures changes dramatically along
inequality. In particular, we focus on documenting the changes in inequality along
those of poverty and the size of the middle class.
