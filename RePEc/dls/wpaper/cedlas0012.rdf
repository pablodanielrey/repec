Title: Simulating Income Distribution Changes in Bolivia: a Microeconometric Approach

Abstract:  This paper uses microeconometric simulations to characterize the distributional
changes occurred in the Bolivian economy in the period 1993-2002, and to
assess the potential distributional impact of various alternative economic
scenarios for the next decade. Wage equations for urban and rural areas
estimated by both OLS and quantile regression are the main inputs for the
microsimulations. A sizeable increase in the dispersion in worker unobserved
wage determinants is the main factor behind the significant increase in
household income inequality in the 90s. The results of the microsimulations
suggest a small poverty-reducing effect of several potential scenarios, including
education upgrading, sectoral transformations, labor informality reduction,
gender and race wage gap closing, and changes in the structure of the returns to
education. Sustainable and vigorous productivity growth seems to be a
necessary condition for Bolivia to meet the poverty Millennium Development
Goal by 2015.
