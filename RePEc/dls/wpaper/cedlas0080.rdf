Title: SME Access to Credit in Guatemala and Nicaragua: Challenging Conventional Wisdom with New Evidence

Abstract: This paper develops a conceptual framework and offers new statistical evidence on the access to
credit by micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Guatemala and Nicaragua. To this
end, and after reviewing the existing literature on the topic, it produces new empirical evidence
drawn from the official Household Survey and the World Bank’s Investment Climate Survey,
conducted in both countries in 2006. The core contribution of the paper lies in the critical
revision of three pieces of common knowledge, namely: (1) A large fraction of MSMEs has an
excess demand for credit; (2) In the presence of credit market failures, governments must and
actually do assist MSMEs in gaining access to loan facilities; and (3) Alternative credit
instruments, such as leasing, factoring, microcredit, and third-party guarantee schemes, can be a
suitable and massive solution for the lack of financing. Our analysis refutes to a large extent
these assertions and advances some basic policy prescriptions that should help improve the
resource allocation and impact of specific MSME financial programs.
