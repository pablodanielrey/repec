Title: Exploring Trends in Labor Informality
in Latin America, 1990-2010

Abstract: Labor informality is a pervasive characteristic of the labor markets in Latin
America, and a central issue in the public policy debate. This paper discusses the
concept of labor informality and implements alternative definitions using
microdata from around 300 national household surveys in all Latin American
countries. The analysis covers two decades: while labor informality, defined as
lack of social protection related to employment, remained with few changes in the
1990s, there is a discernible downward pattern during the 2000s in most countries.
These movements reveal a counter-cyclical behavior of labor informality, that may
be linked to segmentation in the labor market.
