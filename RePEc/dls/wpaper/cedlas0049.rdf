Title: Land-Rich Economies, Education and Economic Development
Abstract: We analyze the emergence of large-scale education systems in a
framework where growth is associated with changes in the conguration
of the economy. We model the incentives that the economic elite
could have (collectively) to accept taxation destined to nance the education
of credit-constrained workers. Contrary to previous work, in
our model this incentive does not necessarily arise from a complementarity
between physical and human capital in manufacturing. Instead,
we emphasize the demand for human-capital-intensive services by highincome
groups. Our model seems capable to account for salient features
of the development of Latin America in the 19th century, where, in particular,
land-rich countries such as Argentina established an extensive
public education system and developed a sophisticated service sector
before starting signicant manufacturing activities.
