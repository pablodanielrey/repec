Title: Trade Reforms and Industry Wage Premium:
Evidence from Argentina

Abstract: This paper studies the impact of Argentina trade liberalization during the nineties on
the industry wage premium structure. We find that accounting for unobserved timeinvariant
industry characteristics is crucial. When we do not control for industry fixed
effects, we find that workers in protected sectors receive lower wages. However,
introducing industry fixed effects reverses the results; tariff protection creates sector
specific rents that are in part translated to workers in terms of greater wages. Since
Argentina’s tariff structure during this period protected relatively more sectors
employing higher proportions of skilled workers, nineties trade policy may have had
an adverse effect on Argentina’s income distribution
