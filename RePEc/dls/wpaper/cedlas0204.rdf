Title: The Anatomy of Behavioral Responses to Social Assistance when Informal Employment is High

Abstract: The disincentive effects of social assistance programs on registered (or formal) employment
are a first order policy concern in developing and middle income countries. Means tests determine
eligibility with respect to some income threshold, and governments can only verify
earnings from registered employment. The loss of benefit at some level of formal earnings is
an implicit tax – a notch – that results in a strong disincentive for formal employment, and
there is extensive evidence on its effects. We study an income-tested program in Uruguay and
extend this literature by developing an anatomy of the behavioral responses to this program
and by establishing its welfare implications in full. Our identification strategy is based on a
sharp discontinuity in the program’s eligibility rule. We rely on information on the universe
of applicants to the program for the period 2004-2012 (about 400,000 individuals) from the
program’s records, from administrative data on registered employment from the social security
administration, and from a complementary follow-up survey with information on informal work.
We construct the anatomy of the program’s effects along four dimensions. First, we establish
that, as predicted by the theory, beneficiaries respond to the program’s incentives by reducing
their levels of registered employment by about 8 percentage points. Second, we find substantial
heterogeneity in these effects: the program induces a larger reduction of formal employment
for individuals with a medium probability to be a registered employee, suggesting some form
of segmentation – those with a low propensity to work formally do not respond to the financial
incentives of the program, probably because they have limited opportunities in the labor market
to begin with. Third, the follow-up survey allows us to establish that the fall in registered
employment is due to a larger extent (about two thirds) to an increase in unregistered employment,
and to a lesser extent (about one third) to a shift towards non-employment. Fourth, we
find an elasticity of participation in registered employment of about 1.7. These results imply a
deadweight loss from the behavioral responses to the program of about 3.2% of total registered
labor income.
