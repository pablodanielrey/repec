Title: The Half-Life of Happiness: Hedonic Adaptation in
the Subjective Well-Being of Poor Slum Dwellers to
a Large Improvement in Housing

Abstract: A fundamental question in economics is whether happiness increases pari passu with
improvements in material conditions or whether humans grow accustomed to better
conditions over time. We rely on a large-scale experiment to examine what kind of impact the
provision of housing to extremely poor populations in Latin America has on subjective
measures of well-being over time. The objective is to determine whether poor populations
exhibit hedonic adaptation in happiness derived from reducing the shortfall in the satisfaction
of their basic needs. Our results are conclusive. We find that subjective perceptions of wellbeing
improve substantially for recipients of better housing but that after, on average, eight
months, 60% of that gain disappears.
