Title: Recent Trends in Inequality and Poverty
in Developing Countries

Abstract: This chapter reviews the empirical evidence on the levels and trends in
income/consumption inequality and poverty in developing countries. It
includes a discussion of data sources and measurement issues, evidence
on the levels of inequality and poverty across countries and regions, an
assessment of trends in these variables since the early 1980s, and a
general discussion of their determinants. There has been tremendous
progress in the measurement of inequality and poverty in the
developing world, although serious problems of consistency and
comparability still remain. The available evidence suggests that on
average the levels of national income inequality in the developing world
increased in the 1980s and 1990s, and declined in the 2000s. There was
a remarkable fall in income poverty since the early 1980s, driven by the
exceptional performance of China over the whole period, and the
generalized improvement in living standards in all the regions of the
developing world in the 2000s.
