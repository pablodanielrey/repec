Title: Housing, Health and Happiness
Abstract: Despite the importance of housing for people’s well-being, there is little evidence
on the causal impact of housing and housing improvement programs on health
and welfare. In this paper, we help to fill this gap by investigating the impact of a
large-scale effort by the Mexican Government to replace dirt floors with cement
floors on child health and adult happiness. We find that replacing dirt floors with
cement floors significantly improves the health of young children. Specifically,
we find significant decreases in the incidence of parasitic infestations, diarrhea,
and the prevalence of anemia, and an improvement in children’s cognitive
development. Additionally, we find that replacing dirt floors by cement floors
significantly improves adult welfare, as measured by increased satisfaction with
their housing and quality of life, as well as by lower scores on depression and
perceived stress scales.
