Title: Tests for Unbalanced Error Component Models Under Local Misspecication

Abstract: This paper derives unbalanced versions of the tests statistics for ¯rst order serial correlation
and random individual e®ects summarized in Sosa Escudero and Bera (2001), and updates their xttest1
routine. The derived tests statistics should be useful for applied researchers faced with the increasing
availability of panel information where not every individual or country is observed for the full time span.
Also, as it was the case of the previously available tests, the test statistics proposed here are based on
the OLS residuals, and hence are computationally very simple.
