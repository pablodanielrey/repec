Title: A Mapping of Labor Mobility Costs in the Developing World

Abstract: Estimates of labor mobility costs are needed to assess the responses of employment and wages to a trade shock when factor adjustment is costly. 
Available methods to estimate those costs rely on panel data, which are seldom available in developing countries. 
In this paper, we propose a method to estimate mobility costs using data that is more easily obtainable worldwide. 
Our estimator matches observed employment flows with those flows predicted by a model of costly labor adjustment. 
We estimate a mapping of labor mobility costs for the developing world and we use those estimates to explore the response of labor markets (wages and employment) to trade policy.
