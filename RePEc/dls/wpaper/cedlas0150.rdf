Title: The Effects of Electrification on Employment in
Rural Peru

Abstract: We examine the effects of a rural electrification program on
employment in Peru. Exploiting the roll-out of the program across
districts over time, we adopt differences-in-differences and fixedeffects
strategies to estimate the impact of the program on labor
market outcomes. The results from our preferred specification
suggest that, among males, providing electrification increases
hours of work and diminishes the likelihood of having a second occupation.
Among females, the treatment rises earnings and these
gains seem to be driven by a shift towards non-agricultural jobs.
Then, we construct a measure of treatment intensity and show
that each additional electrification project increases the magnitude
of the estimated impacts (in absolute terms).
