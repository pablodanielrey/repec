Title: Financing the Sustainable Management of Rwanda’s
Protected Areas

Abstract: Rwanda’s Nyungwe National Park is a biodiversity hotspot with the most endemic species in the
ecoregion as well as the highest number of threatened species internationally. In addition to great
biological diversity, Nyungwe National Park supplies significant ecosystem services to the
Rwandan population including water provisioning and tourism services. Tourism in the Park has
strong potential for improving the sustainable management of the Park for continued provision of
natural habitat and critical ecosystem services. This paper explores quantitatively the economic
impacts of adjustment in Park visitation fees and tourism demand as a source of revenues to
improve Park tourism opportunities and ongoing operations and maintenance where budgetary
restrictions are particularly acute. The methods developed in this paper are novel in integrating
the results of stated preference techniques with regional economy-wide modelling approaches to
capture multi-sectoral, direct, indirect and induced impacts. Such methods have strong potential
for assessing revenue generation alternatives in other contexts where Park Managers are faced
with the need to generate additional revenue for sustainable park management while facing
diminishing budget allocations.
