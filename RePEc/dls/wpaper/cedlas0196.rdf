Title: Intergenerational Mobility and the Rise and Fall of Inequality: Lessons from Latin America

Abstract: Countries with high income inequality also show a strong association between parents’
and children’s economic well-being; i.e. low intergenerational mobility. This study is the first
to test this relationship in a between and within country setup, using harmonized micro data
from 18 Latin American countries spanning multiple cohorts. It is shown that experiencing
higher inequality in childhood has a negative effect on intergenerational mobility as adults.
Furthermore, the influence of economic growth and public education is evaluated: both have
a positive, significant, and substantial effect on intergenerational mobility.
