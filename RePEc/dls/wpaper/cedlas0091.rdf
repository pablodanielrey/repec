Title: The Quality of Life in Prisons: Do Educational Programs Reduce In-prison Conflicts?

Abstract: The harshness of punishment society chooses to impose on crime offenders
is mandated by law. However, the quality of life in prison can make this punishment 
harsher. This creates a variation in the severity of punishment which
is not legislated and may differ from society's taste for penalties. Indicators
of in prison violence and conflicts seem to be appropriate proxy variables for
prison conditions. Using indicators of in prison violent behavior, we use an
exogenous source in education participation in educational programs in order
to asses the effect of education on such measures of conflict. Applying instrumental 
variables techniques to census data for Argentine prisons, we find that
educational programs significantly reduce indicators of property damages in
prison. Such reductions amounts to a 60 percent decrease relative to the mean
level of property damages.
