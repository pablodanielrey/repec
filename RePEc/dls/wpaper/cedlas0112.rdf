Title:  Deprivation and the Dimnensionality of Welfare: A Variable-Selection Cluster-Analysis Approach
Abstract: In this paper we tackle the problems of dimensionality of welfare and that of identifying
the multidimensionally poor by first finding the poor using the original space
of attributes, and then reducing the welfare space. The starting point is the notion
that the ‘poor’ constitutes a group of individuals that are essentially different from the
‘non-poor’ in a truly multidimensional framwework. Once this group has been identified,
we propose reducing the dimension of the original welfare space by solving the
problem of finding the smallest set of attributes that can reproduce as accurately as
possible the ‘poor/non-poor’ classification in the first stage.
