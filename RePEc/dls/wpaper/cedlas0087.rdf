Title: An Estimation of CPI Biases in Argentina 1985-2005, and its Implications on Real Income Growth and Income Distribution

Abstract: We use the shifts in Engel curves estimated from household surveys to estimate CPI biases
in Argentina between 1985 and 2005. We find that real earning levels increased during this
period between 4.3 and 5.7% faster per year than previously estimated. More surprisingly,
relative to conventional wisdom, that income distribution has improved throughout this
period.
