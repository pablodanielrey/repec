Title: Conditional Cash Transfer Programs and Enforcement of Compulsory Education Laws. The case of Asignación Universal por Hijo in Argentina

Abstract: Argentina has traditionally stood out in terms of educational outcomes
among its Latin American counterparts. Schooling among older children,
however, still shows room for improvement especially among the more
vulnerable. Fortunately, the last decade witnessed a sizeable
improvement in attendance rates for children aged 15 through 17. This
could be related to the 2006 National Education Law that made uppersecondary
education compulsory. In this paper, instead, we claim that the
Asignación Universal por Hijo (AUH) a massive conditional cash transfer
program implemented in 2009 in Argentina may be partly responsible for
this improvement. Using a difference in difference model we estimate
that the program accounts for a 3.9 percentage point increase in
attendance rates among those eligible children aged 15 through 17.
