Title: A Turning Point? Recent Developments on Inequality in Latin America and the Caribbean

Abstract: This paper documents patterns and recent developments on different dimensions of inequality
in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). New comparative international evidence
confirms that LAC is a region of high inequality, although maybe not the highest in the
world. Income inequality has fallen in the 2000s, suggesting a turning point from the
significant increases of the 1980s and 1990s. There have been some significant
improvements toward the reduction in inequalities in the access to primary and secondary
education, and to some services (water, sanitation, electricity, cell phones). However, there is
an increasing gap between the rich and the poor in the access to tertiary education, and
important differences in the access to new technologies.
