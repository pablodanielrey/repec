Title: Property Rights for the Poor: Effects of Land Titling
Abstract: Secure property rights are considered a key determinant of economic development. The
evaluation of the causal effects of property rights, however, is a difficult task as their
allocation is typically endogenous. To overcome this identification problem, we exploit a
natural experiment in the allocation of land titles. In 1981, squatters occupied a piece of
land in a poor suburban area of Buenos Aires. In 1984, a law was passed expropriating
the former owners’ land to entitle the occupants. Some original owners accepted the
government compensation, while others disputed the compensation payment in the slow
Argentine courts. These different decisions by the former owners generated an
exogenous allocation of property rights across squatters. Using data from two surveys
performed in 2003 and 2007, we find that entitled families substantially increased
housing investment, reduced household size, and enhanced the education of their
children relative to the control group. These effects, however, did not take place through
improvements in access to credit. Our results suggest that land titling can be an
important tool for poverty reduction, albeit not through the shortcut of credit access, but
through the slow channel of increased physical and human capital investment, which
should help to reduce poverty in the future generations.
