Title: Growth in Labor Earnings Across the Income. Distribution: Latin America During the 2000s

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to characterize the evolution of labor earnings in Latin America during the
2000s, a decade of markedly poverty reduction. Based on household surveys for six countries, Brazil,
Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras and Mexico, we study clusters of increases in labor earnings across
worker, job, and industry characteristics. Throughout the analysis we allow for worker income
heterogeneity, so as to characterize the evolution of labor earnings across the income distribution. For
three of the six countries, we match the household survey data with industrial data from UNIDO and
COMTRADE and find that increases in productivity and changes in product composition are more
important than industry output as determinants of increases in labor earnings within manufacturing.
