Title: The Effect of Conditional Cash Transfers on Educational Opportunities - Experimental Evidence from Latin America
Abstract: Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) provide income to the poor in an effort to improve current
welfare and promote investment in human and social capital to prevent future deprivation. So far,
the impact evaluation literature has focused on estimating current effects on outcomes such as
school attendance, consumption and labor supply. However, these studies overlook potential
redistributive effects, mainly via the equalization of opportunities. The ensuing analysis draws from
recent contributions in the literature on opportunities and incorporates these with impact evaluation
methods. The main findings indicate a remarkable redistributive effect of CCTs and a positive initial
impact on opportunities. However, while mean outcomes improve markedly, the evidence suggests
that the distribution of opportunities readjusts to the positive gains, perhaps indicating deeply rooted
inequities. These results are expected to encourage discussion on program impact beyond those
evaluated and addressing the programs’ long-term consequences.
