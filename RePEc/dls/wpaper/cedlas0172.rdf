Title: A Review of the OECD Income Distribution
Database

Abstract: In this review we expose the OECD Income Distribution Database to critical
scrutiny, identifying its strengths and weaknesses. As it is almost inevitable
in any critical assessment, we could not avoid being somewhat biased toward
highlighting the limitations, without being similarly emphatic about the
virtues of the database. To partly compensate for this asymmetry, we should
make clear from the outset that this database is a remarkable undertaking
that greatly contributes to the study of income inequality in the OECD
countries and that deserves full praise for allowing researchers free and easy
access to the data. The following comments should then be read bearing
always in mind this positive assessment.
