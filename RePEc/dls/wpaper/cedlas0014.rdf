Title: Implicit Rents from Own-Housing and Income Distribution: Econometric Estimates for Greater Buenos Aires
Abstract:  Most income studies do not take into account the implicit rent obtained by households who
inhabit their own dwellings, a fact that introduces a potentially relevant bias in inequality,
poverty, and welfare measures. In this paper we estimate these implicit rents for the Greater
Buenos Aires area from information of Argentina’s National Household Expenditures
Survey (ENGH) of 1996/7. Based on a sample of households that rent their dwellings,
quantile regressions are used to estimate observed rents from a hedonic model. Estimated
coefficients are applied to households that do not rent their houses or apartments in order to
predict the implicit rent derived from living in an owned house. Estimated implicit rents are
added to the standard notion of household income and various inequality measures are reestimated.
We find that the consideration of these implicit rents reduces inequality due to an
income elasticity of spending in housing less than one, and to the relatively large proportion
of house owners in the lower strata of the income distribution.
