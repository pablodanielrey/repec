Title: Understanding the Determinants of Household Saving: Micro Evidence for Latin America

Abstract: This study centers on the household saving rate in Latin America by
constructing a new database from 27 household surveys in 10 countries.
At the statistical level, about half of the households present negative
saving. This fact, coupled with the discrepancy with national accounts
data, suggests some degree of income underreporting and/or
consumption overreporting. The estimations highlight the overriding
positive role of income in shaping saving decisions. Many other controls
prove to be significant as well. In terms of household saving promotion,
our paper leaves little room for optimism.
