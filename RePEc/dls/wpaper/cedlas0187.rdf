Title: Female Labor Force Participation in Latin America: Patterns and Explanations.

Abstract: Female labor force participation has increased 10 percentage points
between 1990 and 2010. This paper analyzes the possible
determinants of this increase. Among those determinants are changes
in education, family structure, fertility, as well as changes in
socioeconomic environment including wages, returns to working at
home, preferences, and technology, among others. We discuss the
mechanisms behind those determinants by organizing the very large
theoretical and empirical literature on the subject. We then assess the
relative importance of the determinants in two ways. We compute
treatment effects estimated in the literature and combine them with
information about the changes in the causing variables. We also use
data from household surveys and combine them with a dataset of
determinants to find correlations in the data that reinforce or reject
the analysis of the literature review.
