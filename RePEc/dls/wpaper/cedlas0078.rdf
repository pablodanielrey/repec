Title: A Distribution in Motion: The Case of Argentina
Abstract: This paper documents the changes in the income distribution in Argentina from the
mid-1970s to the mid-2000s. Over the period inequality increased substantially. Two
types of episodes have shaped this upward trend: deep macroeconomic crises and
periods of sudden and intense economic liberalization. The sizeable rise in inequality in
the 1990s seems to be associated to reallocations against unskilled-labor intensive
sectors, and skilled-biased technological change within most sectors, both factors
stimulated by the process of economic integration. The depth and speed of the reforms
and the scarcity of public policies to ease the transition contributed to the particular
severity of the income distribution changes. The macro crises and the subsequent
recoveries contributed to the volatility of inequality along this upward trend. The large
macroeconomic crisis of 2001/02 triggered a large jump in inequality, although income
disparities returned to pre-crisis levels as the economy recovered fast, and large cash
transfer programs were implemented.
