Title: Un repaso sobre las políticas de protección social y la distribución del ingreso en Argentina

Abstract: This article describes the main trends in income distribution and poverty in Argentina and discusses their relationship with social protection policies in Argentina and their recent reforms. The aim is to identify paradigms underpinning policy changes that occurred since the last decades of the past century. There was a major expansion in terms of coverage and a departure from the traditional contributory model where access to social protection was limited to workers in the formal sector. This study identifies impacts, although partial, of the programs on welfare indicators, to then discuss their main challenges in terms of accessibility, efficiency and financial sustainability in the future.
