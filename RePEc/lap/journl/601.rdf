Title: Structural Economic Model for Ecuador: a Dollar-ized and Oil-ized Economy

Abstract: The paper develops a Structural Model with the main macroeconomic features of the Ecuadorian economy. It models the main transmission channels of a small open and dollarized economy, highly dependent on oil production and foreign remittances. It is estimated by Bayesian methodsfor the period 2001-2010. The framework highlights the main risks affecting the macroeconomic performance, including the importance of international shocks. It also underscores the importance of the fiscal policies and the independent and significant role of the oil value added in the domestic economy.
