Title: Contributions to social security in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay: Densities, transitions and 
duration

Abstract: Pension programs in Latin America have low coverage. We use large panel databases coming 
from administrative records of Argentina, Chile and Uruguay to characterize the histories of contribution 
of the population. We compute three indicators: density of contribution, transition rates and duration 
of the spells of contribution and no contribution. The picture that emerges is worrisome. The density of 
contributions is low on average and pretty heterogeneous across the population. The spells of 
contribution are short and interruptions are frequent. Transition rates are higher at early ages and 
tend to decline later in life, indicating high turnover among young individuals.
