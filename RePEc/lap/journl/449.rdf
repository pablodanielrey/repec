Title: Estimaciones paramétricas y no paramétricas del ingreso de los ocupados del Gran Buenos Aires

Abstract: In order to analyze  the income distribution of the employed population in Great Buenos Aires the Dagum types I and II, Lognormal and Singh and Maddala Models were adjusted with 1992-1997 income data from the Permanent Household Survey. The probability density function was also estimated with the Kernel Method, which is a non parametric technique.
To compare the goodness of fit of the estimated models a set of indicators proposed by Dagum (1980a) was used. Dagum types I and II and Singh and Maddala Models fitted the data between 1992-1997. The Lognormal distribution fitted the data in 1996 and 1997. The non-parametric estimations showed less concentration for the lower income groups and a higher degree of concentration for middle income groups than the estimated models.
