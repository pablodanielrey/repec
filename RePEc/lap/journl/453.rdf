Title: La demanda del Bien

Abstract: Since the acceptance that Good, or Evil, is implied by every rational behavior and after proposing a certain "function of satisfaction" and a certain  "budgeting restriction",  through Lagrange's  multipliers method it has been obtained a demand of Good as a function of the "expected reward" (for practising Good and avoid Evil) and of "love". The mentioned reward is of a spiritual nature, divine, and the love is of the kind specified by St. Paul in 1-Cor XIII,4-7.
