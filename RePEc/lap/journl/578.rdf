Title: La empresa industrial de América Latina: Análisis de la eficiencia mediante grupos estratégicos

Abstract: This work is twofold. On the one hand, we analyze the presence of strategic groups in four 
sectors (machinery and equipment, chemicals, metal products and textiles) in 14 countries in Latin 
America and the Caribbean. On the other hand, estimate the efficiency of companies and their countries 
of origin (country-effect) with best practices (best-practice) in order to identify firm's leaders. The 
results obtained show that the strategic groups with higher levels of innovation in product / process or 
external acquisition of technology through licensing are those integrate by companies more efficient.
