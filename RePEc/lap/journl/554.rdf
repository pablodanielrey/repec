Title: Income Dynamics in Argentina During the 1990’s: ‘Mobiles’ Did Change Over Time
Abstract: Using panel data from Argentina during the 1990’s, this paper concludes that, in Argentina, income ‘mobiles’ did change over time. Among the household variables with a structural relation with income dynamics, we find university education, protecting from income declines though not necessarily linked to upward movements, certain age ranges of the highest earner positively associated with family income losses and households in which the highest earner is a woman exhibiting larger income gains. Interestingly, once we controlled for other correlates, no clear structural relationship was found between initial economic position and subsequent income change. If any, this relationship is positive.
