Title: Segregación ocupacional por género y diferencial de ingresos en turismo: evidencia para Argentina

Abstract: The aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between occupational segregation by gender and the income gap in employment in tourism in Argentina. The methodology proposed by Macpherson and Hirsch (1995) is used. The results show that occupational segregation increases the income differential by gender in tourism, although the effect is less that in non-tourism sector. While occupational segregation is important to understand the maintenance of the earnings differential against women in the tourism sector, a substantial part of it is attributable to the gender of individuals.
