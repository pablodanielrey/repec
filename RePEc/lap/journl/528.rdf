Title: El precio de los terrenos y el valor de sus atributos. Un enfoque de precios hedónicos

Abstract: One of the most interesting characteristics in urban plots markets is that differentiated products are traded in integrated markets. Urban plots are composite goods whose utility for the consumer depends on the utility yield by each one of the characteristics or attributes that compose them. 
The technique used to study the contributions of each one of those characteristics to the market price of urban plots in the city of San Miguel of Tucumán, is the econometric estimation of hedonic equations, whose regressors are the attributes of the urban plots. 
It is found that location variables (commercial areas and commercial surroundings) have the greatest impact on prices. On the other hand, variables associated with the availability of public utilities are less important. It is also found that the price per square meter diminishes as the size of the urban plot increases. This is consistent with the results obtained by Figueroa and Lever for the case of Santiago de Chile.
