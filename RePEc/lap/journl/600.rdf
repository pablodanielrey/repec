Title: Desigualdad multidimensional de los hogares: tipos de hogares y variables predictoras

Abstract: This paper analyzes how certain characteristics of the household and their household heads affect the chances of urban households in the Great Buenos Aires and Pampean region to belong to different classes identified based on a multidimensional exploratory analysis of the inequality phenomenon. Classes found are four: one characterized by deep deprivations, other two that distinguished themselves primarily by access to basic services, and a last one with good general living conditions. It is concluded that, among the analyzed characteristics, many proved to be significant predictors of the likelihood of households to belong to each one of the classes found.
