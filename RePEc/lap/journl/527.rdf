Title: A note on the credibility of Bank-Run-Preventing Devaluation policies

Abstract: In this note I provide a notion of a credible devaluation policy in the context of the Chang and Velasco (2000) model. I show that when the long term asset is illiquid enough a flexible exchange rate policy is credible.  It is also shown that there exists a non-trivial range for the liquidation value of the long term investment technology for which the same policy is not credible. Finally I propose a different flexible exchange rate regime which is shown to be credible.
