Title: A Note On Optimal Insurance in an Information Constrained Federal Economy with Incomplete Degree of Enforceability and Negotiation Costs
Abstract: This paper studies the constrained efficient intergovernmental
transfer contract between the central government and the states
in a federal economy. We consider an environment with moral
hazard, incomplete enforceability and date 0 negotiation costs.
The interaction of moral hazard and incomplete enforceability
may imply that when the state’s resources are ”low enough”, it is
constrained efficient that the state gets a lower utility level than
in autarky.
When negotiation costs are considered, the state might not accept
the contract. More importantly, the possibility of whether
accepting or not is not monotonically determined by the state’s
fiscal situation.
