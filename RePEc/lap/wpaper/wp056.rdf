Title: Poder de Mercado en las Profesiones Autorreguladas: El Desempeño Médico en Argentina.
Abstract: The potentially anticompetitive nature of some practices driven by professional organizations 
has been approached in economic literature and appears as an important issue in the antitrust organism’s agenda.
However, empirical economics lacks of a self-regulated professionals analysis. This work relates the market
for professional services with vertical product differentiation models and uses a Mixed Logit model to assess
the medical profession behavior in Argentina. The evidence suggests the existence of a price arrangement.
