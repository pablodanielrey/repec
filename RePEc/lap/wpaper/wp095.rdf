Title: Real State as Housing and as Financial Investment: 
A First Assessment for Argentina 
Abstract: There exists a widespread perception that Argentine households channel a large share 
of their savings into real state. However, no hard evidence has produced to date to 
measure how important this saving behavior is for the determination of housing prices 
vis-à-vis the traditional housing motive to buy property. In this light, this paper 
assesses for the first time whether housing prices in Argentina are mostly driven by 
housing or by investment motives. To this end, we devised a simple empirical test 
taking the form of an Equilibrium Correction model of apartment prices in Buenos 
Aires City on four explanatory variables that separately capture the housing motive 
(affordability and mortgage loans) and the investment motive (private bank deposits 
and income). It is found that private bank deposits and income have strong long and 
short run effects on housing prices behavior. Affordability only shows a short run 
effect, while mortgage loans turn out to be non-significant. These findings suggest, in 
line with the popular view on this topic, that real state fulfills a prominent role as a 
financial investment in Argentina.
