Title: Determinantes del avance en los niveles de educación en Argentina
Análisis empírico basado en un modelo probabilístico secuencial.
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to study the education a person acquires and the
determining factors of mentioned result. With this in mind, education is conceived as a
sequential process of decisions. The educational categories that result from this process
are incomplete primary, complete primary, incomplete secondary, complete secondary
and higher level education. Based on data for 1997 from the Social Development Survey,
a sequential logit model is applied, constructed from four conditional logit models used to
estimate, respectively, the probability of completing primary school, attending secondary
school, completing secondary school and attaining higher level education. The estimated
results indicate that the socioeconomic characteristics are significant determinants of the
education a person acquires and have important effects over the probabilities of meeting
the different educational levels.
