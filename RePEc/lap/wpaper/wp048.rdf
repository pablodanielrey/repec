Title: What Determines the Access to Credit by SMEs in Argentina?
Abstract: This work discusses the determinants of the access to credit for a sample of about 140
Argentine small and medium firms, based on a unique database gathered by the Union
Industrial Argentina in 1999. Among other findings, the evidence shows that the
acceptance of overdraft lines at high interest rates and very short maturity is an
important factor regarding the probability of getting a bank loan, while the availability
of collateral does not seem to affect such probability. All in all, the results appear to
be consistent with a risk taking behavior by banks in their loan policy toward this set
of firms, an observation seemingly at odds with the conservative strategy that
presumably banks follow.
