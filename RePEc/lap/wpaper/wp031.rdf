Title: Esquemas Cambiarios y Monetarios Alternativos en un Modelo de
Interdependencia Macroeconómica entre Argentina y Brasil
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical model of macroeconomic interdependence between Argentina
and Brazil in which alternative monetary and exchange rate regimes are represented. Simulation
exercises are carried out with the objective of giving some clues for the election of the most
appropriate model for Argentina. The election criteria consists of minimizing the real GDP
volatility and that of the CPI when shocks are produced. In the first case the favorite models are
those of more exchange rate flexibility while in the second case it will be preferable a more rigid
set up of exchange rate. If real GDP volatility matters as much as that of the CPI, then
Dolarization achieves a good trade-off among both because it maintains stable dollar prices while
eliminating a fluctuation source in the interest rate (and by this way in the GDP) like the
devaluation risk. That advantage decreases when the importance of the devaluation risk falls
against the default risk as a component of the interest rate and as the supply of non- tradables
goods becomes more inelastic.
