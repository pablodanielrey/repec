Title: Los Cambios en la Distribución del Ingreso de Argentina entre 1998 Y 2005: Un Análisis
de Microdescomposiciones Utilizando Información de Paneles
Abstract: This paper analyses the changes in inequality occurred during the period 1998 – 2005. A set
of results are presented in order to contribute to a better understanding of the changes in inequality.
The obtained results show that important distributive effects were hidden by the apparent observed
distribution stability between both years. The returns to education have played an important role in
the rise in inequality while the rise in the unobservable factors and the higher levels of employment
seem to have reduced it.
