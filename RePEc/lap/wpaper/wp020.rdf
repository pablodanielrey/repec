Title: Raíces unitarias y ciclos en las principales variables macroeconómicas de argentina
Abstract: In this paper we study the integration properties of some of the main macroeconomic series of
Argentina. We present a robust methodology for the analysis of persistence of shocks
affecting macroeconomic series and its consequences on the modeling of the cyclical and
permanent components.
Our strategy consists on testing the stationarity of the series by using a sequence of
indicators in such a way that we can analyze the problem from three converging points of
 view: Persistence of the series, Unit Root (UR) and UR with a Structural Breaks, thus
reaching robust results regarding the integration properties of the main 14 Argentinean
macroeconomic time series.
We are able to classify them in four homogenous groups according to its order of integration.
This allows us to determine the best strategy for modeling the cyclical component of each
variable. For example, we found that the GDP can be robustly considered integrated of order
one, I (1)
