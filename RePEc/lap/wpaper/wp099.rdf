Title: El Efecto de la Demanda del Bien en la Asignación de Recursos 
Abstract: This paper highlights the influence of Values in the assignation of resources 
between the satisfying things implying the Good (Xi) and the ones implying the 
Evil (Xj), through the analysis of the behavior of an individual with a demand for 
Good (GD). 
It is shown that if the demand for Good were zero, the 100% of the monetary 
income would be assigned to Xj. If the individual increased in Values, a bigger 
share of the income would be assigned to Xi; and if his GD were infinitum, all 
his income would be assigned to Xi.
