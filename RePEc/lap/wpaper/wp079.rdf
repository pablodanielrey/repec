Title: The Financial Impact of the IDB’s Liquidity Program for Growth
Sustainability.
Abstract: This paper assesses the impact of the Liquidity Program for Growth Sustainability
(LPGS) on Latin America and the Caribbean, instrumented by the IDB to confront the
regional spillovers of the subprime crisis. This emergency liquidity line was set up to
boost productive loans of commercial banks, channeled through a second-tier scheme.
The empirical strategy revolves around GARCH models to test whether the public
announcement of negotiations and of loan approval have had any impact on high
frequency macroeconomic data, such as the country risk premium and the interbank
interest rate. Our evidence reveals a positive and significant effect on financial stability
attributable to LPGS in Jamaica, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic and
Panama. We additionally discuss the rationale of key LPGS’ design features and the
observed outcomes.
