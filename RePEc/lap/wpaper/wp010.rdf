Title: Una Primera Aproximación al Crimen en la Argentina
Abstract:The security problem is one of the major issues in the
policy-makers agendas. At the same time is one of main
worries of present society. As a result, appears a
necessity to develop theoretical and empirical models of
crime and punishment. Economists have been involved in
this topic. In particular this paper finds evidence that
supports the theory of deterrence: criminals are rational
agents that take into account the probability of being
convicted and the severity of punishment.
