Title: Financial Crisis and Sectoral Diversification of Argentine Banks,
1999-2004.
Abstract: We explore the impact and evolution of loan portfolio diversification
during the 2001-2002 Argentine financial crisis. Using a novel dataset
that combines public information on the main activity of the largest
930 Argentine firms with their borrowing from each bank operating in
the country during the 1999-2004 period, we find that banks did not
modify much their loan portfolio mix as a response to the crisis, even
though the econometric results point to a positive effect of sectoral
diversification and lending to tradeable sectors on bank profitability
and risk mitigation. Our results suggest that larger banks benefit more
from diversification that smaller ones, and that the benefits of
diversification are greater during the downside of the business cycle.
