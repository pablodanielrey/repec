Title: La Incidencia de las Políticas Públicas sobre la Actividad Rural, 
el Escenario Comparado y la Propuesta de Reforma Tributaria
Abstract: The paper analyzes public policies on the rural sector implemented in our country, 
within an international compared approach, and its implications for Argentina's 
economic performance, particularly its agricultural sector. The analysis derives toward 
our insistence on the need for a federal tax system reform, particularly referred to real 
state and land taxation, and the role that within this tax source has the Rural Property 
Tax (Impuesto Inmobiliario Rural) in provinces. A new explanation of the 
characteristics of this tax reform is advanced in the paper.
