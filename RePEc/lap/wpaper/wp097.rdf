Title: Credit vs. Payment Services: 
Financial Development and Economic Activity Revisited 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to assess whether the banking system, over and 
beyond its credit function, has a significant impact on per capita GDP by 
providing means of payment. An annual database of 85 countries spanning the 
1980-2008 period is exploited to this end. On the descriptive front, we find that 
richer economies exhibit higher and increasing levels of demand deposits and 
lower levels of currency than poor countries. While this was to be expected, 
more surprising is the fact that the currency to GDP ratio did not decrease 
much over time, regardless of income level differences. In turn, our regressions 
confidently support the hypothesis that banks contribute to economic 
development not only as credit suppliers but also by facilitating transactions. 
Specifically, along with the ratio of private credit to GDP, the ratio of demand 
deposits to currency seems to exert a positive influence on per capita GDP. The 
results are robust for different model specifications. These findings have 
valuable implications for a better understanding of the channels through which 
the banking system affects the economy.
