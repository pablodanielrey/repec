Title: Universitary Financing and Welfare: A Dynamic Analysis with
Heterogeneous Agents and Overlapping Generations
Abstract: This paper develops a model in which it is possible to evaluate alternatives
of human capital …nancing. The alternative systems under discussion are: total
feeing; graduates taxes and uniform taxes (this can be associated to the scheme
presently used in the Argentina universitary system).
Assessment of the alternatives is performed over welfare, based on the indicators
of poverty, equality, equity (justice in the distribution) and the average
levels of utility and wealth. Likewise, the functions of welfare presented by
Bentham, Rawls, Atkinson, Sen and Kakwani are also considered.
The most remarkable results are obtained through the simulation of an
economy under three scenarios. In that way, the system of graduates taxation
is found to be better for welfare; whereas the system of uniform taxation only
can be justi…ed as it maximises the number of students. In addition, an analysis
of political economy in this model helps to understand why a system of uniform
taxation can be sustainable on the time.
