Title: An Evaluation of the Contractionary Devaluation Hypothesis.
Abstract: Recent empirical and theoretical literature on the impact of real exchange rate
devaluations on economic performance questions the traditional expansionary
effect generated within standard Mundell-Fleming models. Contractionary
devaluations may arise when firms face maturity or currency mismatches that,
when faced with real exchange rate depreciations, lead to balance-sheet effects
that erode firms’ wealth and lead to an output contraction. While some authors
show that the standard Mundell-Fleming result may hold even in the presence of
currency mismatches, others point out that, if the balance sheet effect is large
enough, devaluations can be contractionary. Using a large panel of 57 countries
across the world and various newly constructed measures of dollarization, we test
whether the balance sheet effect hypothesis has been relevant during the past
decades in explaining economic downturns. Additionally, we explore the channels
through which devaluations can be contractionary; in particular, we explore
whether investment and consumption decisions are negatively affected by
exchange rate devaluations under currency mismatches.
