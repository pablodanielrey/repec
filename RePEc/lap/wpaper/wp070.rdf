Title: VAT Incidence, Tax on Exports and the Measurement of Tax Burden
on Tradable Goods: the Agricultural Sector Case.
Abstract: This paper analyzes conceptual issues dealing with the measurement of “sector tax
burden”, specifically the methodological treatment of the Value Added Tax (VAT) and Tax
on Exports, with particular reference to the Agricultural Sector. First, notions of tax impact
(statutory or legal incidence), tax burden shifting and economic incidence of VAT applied
to domestic goods are considered; second, the case of commercial (tradable) goods or
commodities, which is the relevant case for Agricultural Sector. In this last case, Tax on
Exports is also taken into account. Conclusions lead to recommend changes to the usual
estimation of sector tax burden, which is considered wrong or at least incomplete in its
treatment.
