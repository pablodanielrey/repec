Title: Individual Heterogeneity in the Returns to Schooling: Instrumental Variables Quantile Regression using Twins Data
Abstract: Considerable effort has been exercised recently in estimating mean returns to
education while carefully considering biases arising from unmeasured ability and measurement
error. Some of this work has also attempted to determine whether there are variations from
the “mean” return to education across the population with mixed results. In this paper, we use
recent extensions of instrumental variables techniques to quantile regression on a sample of
twins to estimate an entire family of returns to education at different quantiles of the
conditional distribution of wages while addressing simultaneity and measurement error biases.
We test whether there is individual heterogeneity in returns to education against the alternative
that there is a constant return for all workers. Our estimated model provides evidence of two
sources of heterogeneity in returns to schooling. First, there is evidence of a differential effect
by which more able individuals become better educated because they face lower marginal
costs of schooling. Second, once this endogeneity bias is accounted for, our results provide
evidence of the existence of actual heterogeneity in market returns to education consistent
with a non-trivial interaction between schooling and unobserved abilities in the generation of
earnings. The evidence suggests that higher ability individuals (those further to the right in the
conditional distribution of wages) have higher returns to schooling but that returns vary
significantly only along the lower quantiles to middle quantiles. In our final approach, the
resulting estimated returns are never lower than 9 percent and can be as high as 13 percent at
the top of the conditional distribution of wages, thus providing rather tight bounds on the true
return to schooling. Our findings have meaningful implications for the design of educational
policies.
