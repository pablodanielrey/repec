Title: The Demand for Mortgages under Macro Volatility: The Argentine Case 
Abstract: This paper analyzes mortgage loan demand in Argentina using a new survey 
administered in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area. It is found that recurring 
macro volatility and violation of financial property rights have increased demand 
for real estate as an investment, which in turn raises house prices and makes it 
more difficult for consumer households to meet minimum income requirements 
for obtaining a mortgage. Affordability thus seems to offer a better explanation 
than standard supply side constraints for the small size of the mortgage market in 
Argentina. Overall, the findings suggest that the shallow mortgage market has not 
posed a major impediment to home ownership rate in Argentina and that the small 
(and shrinking) mortgage market has more to do with lack of demand than credit 
supply constraints.
