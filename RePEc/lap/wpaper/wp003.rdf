Title: Confusing Fixed and Variable Costs under Ramsey Regulation
Abstract: Ramsey regulation, in the context of tariff rebalancing,
is analyzed when the regulator is not fully informed about the cost
structure of the firm. It is shown that even if the estimated
relation between variable costs of the two goods produced is
correct, errors regarding the composition of a given total cost
between fixed and variable elements result in: (i) the price of the
good with a higher (lower) elasticity of demand decreases
(increases) as the estimated fixed cost is higher; and (ii)
whatever mistake is made, i.e., under or over estimating fixed
costs, the profits obtained by the regulated firm are lower than intended.
