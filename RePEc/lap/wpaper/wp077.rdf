Title: Taxation on Rural Sector: Tax Burden, Land Value and Property
Right.
Abstract: The paper analyzes tax burden on rural sector and its implication on property right of land.
First, tax burden on land property and rural activities, and its incidence on land values are
analyzed; next, the author tries to advance an economic foundation theory for evaluating a
legal quantitative limit for the determination that judicial intervention had established, or
may establish in the future, to define or differentiate tax burden as confiscatory and,
therefore, violating property right.
