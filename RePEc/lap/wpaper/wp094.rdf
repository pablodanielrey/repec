Title: El Reto de Edmund Phelps: 
Las Crisis y los Modelos Económicos
Abstract: The paper attempts an explanation of the alleged "lack of adequate economic models" to predict 
and eventually avoid - using certain policy recommendations - the recurrent financial and fiscal 
crises, and finally, economic crisis, recurrently registered in the world. From author opinion, in 
the controversy over the "rational expectation" approach and the new design method of dynamic 
and stochastic models, have been neglected some important underlying issues in economic 
performance, as the very crucial institutional basis on which activities of economic agents 
operate, including as such particularly to governments. The Public Choice school and modern 
Institutional Economics can help to understand the limitations and possibilities facing economic 
theory in improving its status as "science."
