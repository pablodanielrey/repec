Title: Equilibrio Individual y Equilibrio General en Presencia de 
Bienes Públicos con Funciones de Utilidad Altruistas: 
Una Reformulación de las Condiciones Samuelsonianas 
Abstract: This paper aims to clarify the characteristics and attributes of the method of benefit in the 
distribution of tax burdens to finance public goods. The implications of the Samuelson 
conditions on the criteria of efficiency and equity in taxation, and a reformulation of these 
conditions, designed to ensure that collective decisions, while respecting the sovereignty of 
citizens or voters, ensure not only an efficient allocation, but also an equitable distribution of 
public burdens. For this, the replacement of traditional neoclassical utility functions by altruistic 
utility functions can obtain a "non-rival outcome" to ensure, at the same time, criteria of 
efficiency and equity in taxation.
