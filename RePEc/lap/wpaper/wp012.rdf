Title: La Cobertura en Salud en el Área Metropolitana. Un Análisis Empírico en Base a Modelos de Elección Binaria y Multinomial 
Abstract: The primary objective of the present paper is to explore the relationship between health
coverage and the socio-economic and demographic characteristics at the individual level.
The empirical analysis, based on the Permanent Household Survey of 1992 for the
Metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, is directed to explore not only the determinants of
coverage (whether to have health insurance or not) but also the type of insurance. The
probability of being covered is estimated with a Logit Model, while for the estimation of
the probability of having each different kind of insurance a Multinomial Logit Model is
used. The results of this exercise reveal that the socio-economic characteristics of the
individuals affect both the probability of being covered and the probability of having each
type of health insurance. The article presents a detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis
of these findings. Moreover, a methodology to predict the population coverage using
limited information is presented as an additional contribution.
