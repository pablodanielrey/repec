Title: Assessing Aggregate Welfare: Growth and Inequality in Argentina
Abstract: This paper has two main goals. The first is to complement the Argentine mean income series
with inequality estimates in order to obtain aggregate welfare series. Average income figures
are estimated from National Accounts while income inequality indices are calculated from the
Permanent Household Survey (EPH). Household income from the survey is adjusted for
nonresponse, underreporting and demographics. The second objective of the article is to check
the statistical significance of changes in inequality and welfare measures. Bootstrapping
techniques are used to that aim. One of the main conclusions is that while welfare
assessments coincide among different value judgments in some periods (e.g. 1991-1994), they
widely vary in some others, particularly in the last four years (1994-1998), where the economy
experienced moderate growth and large increases in inequality. It is argued that the period
1994-1998 provides an unprecedented laboratory for distinguishing the social preferences of
different analysts according to their evaluation of the performance of the Argentine economy.
