Title: Characterization of inequality changes
through microeconometric decompositions.
The case of Greater Buenos Aires.
Abstract: We apply a variant of the microeconometric decomposition methodology proposed in
Bourguignon et al. (1998) to assess the relevance of various factors that affected
inequality in the period 1986-1998 in the Greater Buenos Aires area. The results of the
paper suggest that the small change in inequality between 1986 and 1992 was the result
of mild forces that compensated each other. In contrast, between 1992 and 1998 nearly
all factors had some role in increasing inequality to unprecedented levels. The increase
in the returns to education, changes in endowments of unobservable factors and their
remunerations, and the fall in hours of work by low-income people are particularly
important to explain the growth in inequality in the nineties. In contrast, although
Argentina witnessed dramatic changes in the gender wage gap, the unemployment rate
and the educational structure, these factors appear to have had only a mild effect on
the household income distribution.
