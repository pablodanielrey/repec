Title: ¿Es posible un Acuerdo Fiscal Federal Sustentable sin una Reforma
del Sistema Tributario Federal?
Abstract: The paper explores the feasibility of a new agreement on the Fiscal and Financial
Federal Coordination System in Argentina and seeks to corroborate the hypothesis that
this would not be feasible and sustainable in the long run without a Reform of the
Federal Tax System, in particular, a reform that involves the removal of tax on exports
(Retenciones) of rural sector production. This would enable a greater degree of
development of regional economies and a consequent greater sub-national “tax-room”
compatible with a genuine federal system of government.
