Title: Direct Democracy And Tax Exporting: Theory and an Application to
the First Referendum ("Consulta Popular") in Argentina
Abstract: The assignment of the responsibility for different taxing powers is one of the most important problems
in the theory and practice of fiscal federalism. The literature provides us with a set of general
guidelines for the “tax assignment problem.” One conclusion is that “tax exporting” could create
perverse signals for fiscal choice. In this paper the “tax exporting” problem is analyzed with simple
models. The case of a tax passed through a referendum (Consulta Popular) in an argentinean tourist
Municipality is studied. In a numerical exercise, using the fiscal data of the Municipality, the size of the
public expenditures is calculated under different rules of fiscal decision. Then, an empirical analysis of
the results of the voting and its determinants is carried out. The paper concludes with some
comments, in order to improve the mechanisms of referendum related to fiscal decisions at the
municipal level.
