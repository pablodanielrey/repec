Title: Fusiones Horizontales: Un Caso de Aplicación para la Argentina
Abstract: This paper studies firm merger and acquisition activities from the perspective of the
economic agents involved and their consequences on economic welfare. In particular, it analyzes
the case of horizontal mergers.
The first chapter describes the legislation on mergers and acquisitions in force from
different countries. The second chapter details the characteristics of these activities, the causes of
their control in practice and the main analytical tools proposed by the literature to evaluate
concentrations. The third chapter quantifies an alternative method to evaluate merger consequences
and applies it to an horizontal merger in Argentina.
The main conclusions are: i) it is necessary to improve the analytical and informative
frames so that the evaluation of merger and acquisition operate in tandem with political economy
decisions; ii) the absence of a unique and complete solution requires the implementation of rules of
reason to evaluate the effects of economic concentrations on welfare and markets; iii) the
parametric focus constitutes an alternative analysis that captures the particular characteristics of
firms, consumers and the market; and that is applicable to a broad set of study cases with available
information.
