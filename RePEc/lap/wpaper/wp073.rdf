Title: El Resultado Fiscal de las Provincias: ¿Exógeno o Endógeno? Una
Mirada de Mediano Plazo.
Abstract: In this paper the fiscal situation of argentinian provinces in the period 1983-2006 is studied
and the impact of national policies is estimated. Without these policies the provinces would
have had surplus versus the deficit that accounting shows. The provincial debt on
December 31st 2006 was lower than the fiscal externality generated by national policies. The
estimations presented here show that in the fiscal relationship between the nation and the
provinces the principle of “institutional loyalty” is not present.
