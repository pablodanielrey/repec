Title: Inversores Financieros en los Mercados de Commodities: Un
Modelo con Dinámica de Ajuste no Lineal al Equilibrio.
Abstract: Commodity prices have been growing fast in the last few years and this has caused
countless economic changes worldwide. This paper looks for a place in this topic offering
a smooth transition vector autoregressive model whose motivation is rooted in the
heterogeneous agent based models literature. The econometric methodology aims at
identifying both those variables that influence prices in the long run –obtaining in this way
an “equilibrium” or “fundamental” price, and the mechanisms that start, strengthen and
eventually correct short run deviations with respect to that equilibrium. The empirical
results suggest that current peaks of commodities should be carefully treated.
Particularly, those records levels should not been automatically taken for granted as
permanent prices for the near future.
