Title: Test for the Error Component Model in the Presence of Local Misspecification 
Abstract: It is well known that most of the standard speci畚ation tests are not valid when the
alternative hypothesis is misspeci疾d. This is particularly true in the error component
model, when one tests for either random e容cts or serial correlation without taking account
of the presence of the other e容ct. In this paper we study the size and power of the
standard Rao's score tests analytically and by simulation when the data is contaminated
by local misspeci畚ation. These tests are adversely a容cted under misspeci畚ation. We
suggest simple procedures to test for random e容cts (or serial correlation) in the presence
of local serial correlation (or random e容cts), and these tests require ordinary least
squares residuals only. Our Monte Carlo results demonstrate that the suggested tests
have good 疸ite sample properties for local misspeci畚ation, and in some cases even for
far distant misspeci畚ation. Our tests are also capable of detecting the right direction
of the departure from the null hypothesis. We also provide some empirical illustrations
to highlight the usefulness of our tests.
