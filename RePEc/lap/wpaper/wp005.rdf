Title:Diferenciación de Productos y Poder de Mercado
Abstract:This paper presents a model of market power analysis in a context of symmetric product
differentiation. Each variety possesses a homogeneous and a heterogeneous component, that
consumers value separately. According to the way in which firms exercise their influence on
prices, four behavioral hypotheses are defined (pure price-taking, monopolistic competition,
Cournot oligopoly and collusion). Each of them implies a different level of global and local market
power, whose relative efficiency is assessed. Conclusions are later extended to contexts where
firms become infinitesimal, and the number of varieties is either finite or infinite.
