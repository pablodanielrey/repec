Title: Dinámica salarial y ocupacional Análisis de panel para Argentina
1998-2002.
Abstract: In this paper it is jointly studied the occupation and the wage stability in Argentina
during the years 1998-2002. Using matched panel data from the EPH survey, it is
analyzed the way in which the characteristics of the worker impact on the wage
volatility and on the probability of being fired or hired. The evidence indicates that
those individuals with relatively low salary face the highest income oscillations
and the highest employment-unemployment rotation. During the deepest period
of the crisis, the employment instability double and the relative wage mobility
remained stable.
