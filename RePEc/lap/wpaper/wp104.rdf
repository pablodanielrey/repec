Title: An Empirical Analysis of Mark-ups in the Argentine Manufacturing Sector
Abstract: In this paper, we estimate mark-ups with plant level production data for Argentina 
from a structural model of cost-minimizing producers, as proposed by De Loecker and Warzynski (2012). 
We explore systematic differences across industries and plants. Our main findings are that mark-ups 
are higher in capital-intensive industries, and for plants that are more productive, larger, 
and more capital-intensive. Our findings are consistent with theories that predict larger mark-ups for 
more efficient firms and for higher quality products.
